                <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                <p>
                I choose this topic given that I love listening to music on Spotify. We can all agree that this platform does an amazing job recommending new music with playlist such as: the daily mix or the discover weekly, which suits perfectly our music taste. Moreover, Spotify has included recently a new feature: an AI DJ. All of this, let me to wonder how does this recommendation system work.<br> <br>
                Clearly, one of the main objectives of this company is to personalize the experience for each user. This recommendation system is based on data-driven algorithms, collaborative filtering, natural language processing and sonic profiles. Following these algorithms, the Spotify’s AI ecosystem can predict the next song a user may want to listen to.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">How does it use these information to recommend?</h2>
        <div class="algorithms-box">
            <p >COLLABORATIVE FILTERING:</p>
            <p>Not only does Spotify use this kind of algorithms, but also other platforms such as Amazon. Basically, Spotify analyses all the data collected and tries to identify similar music tastes. For example, person A may like songs 1, 2 and 3, while person B also listens to songs 1, 2 and 3. What Spotify does now, is to recommend song 4 which person B really likes to person A which has never heard it before. That is collaborative filtering, identifying shared music tastes.
                <br><br>
                The data collected is represented in a huge matrix, each row being a user and each column a song. If one row is similar to another, it would mean that those two users have the same music taste. Now, if row has a song that the other does not, Spotify recommends that song. However, the problem with this algorithm is that popular songs are more recommended than unpopular ones, given that the last ones have 0 listens, which makes it impossible for the algorithm to recommend them. That is the reason why it also uses other algorithms, such as: Natural Language Processing (NPL).

        <div class="algorithms-box">
            <p>Natural Language Processing (NPL)</p>
            <p>Spotify uses NPL to analyse not only the song titles, lyrics or playlist descriptions, but also blogs on the internet, reviews or articles. In other words, social content related to the song and the artist. It the categorizes the songs by the words used to describe them and can identify similar songs this way. By doing this, a song that has 0 listens, but the algorithm has identified them in the same category as another popular song, it will be recommended to users with that music taste.</p>

        <div class="algorithms-box">
            <p>SONIC PROFILES</p>
            <p>
                This last algorithm, unlike the two others had to do with the music itself. Using AI, Spotify analyses directly the features of the audio of a song. To do so, it uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which identifies the features of a song like the tempo, loudness, melody or rhythm. Then, it compares these features individually to other songs to recognize those songs that are similar to the ones a user listens to.

                <p>In this image you can see how collaborative filtering works. However, instead of buy, it should be listen. One user lisens to songs A and B. While, another user listens to songs A, B and C. The algorithm, then, would recommend song C to the first user.</p>

    <div class="topic-container-intro">
        <div class="box-text">
            <p>By applying these main algorithms, the AI can predict which song someone is more likely to want to listen to next, keeping in mind new artist and popular ones. In my opinion, is fascinating to know how the recommendation system works, given that it really does a great job. I really love to use the AI DJ as well when I do not know what to listen to. With feature is what makes me choose Spotify as my main music platform instead of others and I hope that they keep developing these systems. </p>
